# MultiplayerUnityGame
This is the simple top-down mulitplayer shooter, based on UDP sockets connection.  
It's mostly creates for educational purposes.  
Already done:
- Player synchronization.
- NPC's synchronization.
- Bullets, dealing damage.

Ending point of it, create a fully playable demo of the game. 
There's no models/animations in this repository, to not deal with indication of the license for now, but all used assets is royalty-free/free for use.  
There's a lot of things to fix, related to OOP stuff (for example: new file for each class). I know about them, just don't pay attention to it right now.
